    "# Moderation Rules for *Create and Compete* – Elevator Pitch\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a platform where creativity meets competition—this is the essence of our project. Under the theme of **Create and Compete**, we’re designing a space where participants can pitch creative ideas, whether for inventions, stories, apps, or business ventures. The twist? These ideas are sparked by random prompts, pushing users to think outside the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an idea is pitched, the real fun begins. Other participants engage with the pitch by challenging it with insightful questions, offering constructive feedback, and suggesting improvements. The focus here isn’t just on competing to create the best idea but also on fostering collaboration and creativity. Participants learn from one another, pushing the boundaries of their original concepts to create something even more innovative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you’re a writer, designer, entrepreneur, or problem-solver, this platform encourages you to compete by creating and evolving by collaborating.\n",

    "## Moderation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Respectful Communication\n",
    "- **Rule:** All feedback, questions, and suggestions must be respectful and constructive.\n",
    "    - *Guidelines:* Avoid harassment, personal attacks, and discriminatory remarks based on race, gender, nationality, religion, or any other characteristic. Focus critiques on the idea, not the person. Repeat offenses may lead to suspension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Constructive Criticism Only\n",
    "- **Rule:** Provide helpful and actionable feedback.\n",
    "    - *Guidelines:* Avoid vague negativity; focus on specific suggestions to improve the pitch. Ask thoughtful questions that help refine the idea and foster a learning-focused environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Originality and Prompt Adherence\n",
    "- **Rule:** All ideas must be original to the creator.\n",
    "    - *Guidelines:* Plagiarism or copying others' work is prohibited. Ideas should respond to the assigned random prompt. Off-topic ideas may be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. No Inappropriate Content\n",
    "- **Rule:** Language, imagery, or pitches must not contain inappropriate or offensive content.\n",
    "    - *Guidelines:* Avoid violent, explicit, or illegal material. Keep content suitable for a general audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Encourage Diverse Perspectives\n",
    "- **Rule:** Everyone’s creativity and viewpoint are valued.\n",
    "    - *Guidelines:* Engage from a place of curiosity, embracing participants' unique perspectives. Avoid biased or dismissive comments; celebrate diverse approaches to problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Quality and Effort in Engagement\n",
    "- **Rule:** Engage thoughtfully and with purpose.\n",
    "    - *Guidelines:* Avoid “spammy” comments or low-effort feedback. Contribute meaningful feedback that benefits both the creator and other participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Report and Review Process\n",
    "- **Rule:** Report content or behavior that violates these rules.\n",
    "    - *Guidelines:* Use the reporting feature to notify moderators of issues. The moderation team will review all reports and take action to uphold platform standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Collaboration over Competition\n",
    "- **Rule:** Prioritize learning and collaboration over winning.\n",
    "    - *Guidelines:* Avoid unsportsmanlike behavior, such as sabotaging others’ ideas. Uplift others’ ideas to build an inspiring and innovative community.\n",
